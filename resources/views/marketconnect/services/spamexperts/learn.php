The SpamExperts filtering solutions can achieve a near 100% accuracy rate.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Outgoing Email Filtering</strong> prevents your IP(s) from getting blacklisted and ensures all your outgoing email always safely arrives where it should. Outgoing filtering will block spam & viruses from ever leaving your network.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"spamexperts how-it-works\">\n\n            <h3>How it works</h3>\n\n            <br>\n\n            <p>Emails are securely analyzed and scanned by the fully redundant SpamExperts cloud in real time. Threats are quarantined and clean email is sent to the destination mail server.</p>\n            <p>You and your clients remain in full-control through the multi-tenant, multi-lingual, user-friendly SpamPanel control-panel. Plus by using SpamExperts, email continuity is optimized too.</p>\n\n        </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"archiving\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n    <div class=\"content-padded spamexperts\">\n\n        <h3>What is Email Archiving?</h3>\n\n        <br>\n\n        <p>Email Archiving preserves and protects all inbound and outbound email messages for later access. It is a great way to recover lost or accidentally deleted emails, accelerate audit response, secure intellectual property emails and attachments, as well as for “eDiscovery” purposes in case of litigation.</p>\n\n        <p>With Email Archiving from SpamExperts, users get 10GB of compressed email storage and a powerful control panel to manage their archiving from.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"spamexperts how-it-works\">\n\n            <h3>Why is Archiving Important?</h3>\n\n            <br>\n\n            <p>Email Archiving is a critical tool to preserve a secure backup of all email and be legally compliant. As email exchanges have judicial power and are legally binding, so email compliance has become an extremely important concern for organizations. Therefore it is mandatory in certain industries to preserve a secure backup of all email messages and be legally compliant.</p>\n\n        </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"pricing\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n    <div class=\"content-padded\">\n        ";
